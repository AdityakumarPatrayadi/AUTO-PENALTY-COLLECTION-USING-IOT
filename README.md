# AUTO-PENALTY-COLLECTION-USING-IOT
Our System aims at designing an intelligent system which helps the traffic department to
collect pending previous penalty amounts using RFID and IOT technology. The result of this
is the RFID cards which transmit a unique identification number. This number transmitted by
the RFID can be read with the help of a RF reader. The device which is able to perform the
task is a Microcontroller. RFID reader interfaced to Microcontroller. The microcontroller is
programmed in such a way that it continuously reads the input from the RFID reader. To
perform this task, the microcontroller is programmed using embedded ‘C’ language.
